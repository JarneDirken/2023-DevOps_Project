# 🥷🏽 Verbal Memory Test in C#. (Based on human benchmark)

A simple version of the verbal memory test of human benchmark. Saving data in database and making a .exe file with GitHub Actions.

## 📦 Technologies

- `C#`
- `SQL lite`
- `GitHub Actions`

## 🦄 Features

Here's what you can do with my application:

- **Memorize words**: Try to memorize which words you have allready seen.

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

In this uncomplicated project, my goal was to develop an application in C#. I opted for a simplified version of the Memory Test found in Human Benchmark.

The initial steps involved crafting the overall layout and ensuring the functionality of the application.

I diligently documented the entire process along with a brief demonstration, and the link to the GitHub repository is provided (in Dutch). Additionally, a concise demo is available at the conclusion of the readme file.

You should be able to add data to the database and retrieve it. In my case the highscore of the best user. Also we needed to make a .exe file with GitHub Actions.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've improved my C# and problem solving skills. Also leared a thing or two about storing data in a database and retrieving it.

### 🧠 Brain:

- **Problem solving**: First time making a application with C#. This game with a fare share of bugs and problems.

### ⌚ Time management:

- **Using scrum board**: Keeping track of all my tasks using a scrum board really made everything organised. For this project I used Trello.

### 📓 New knowledge:

- **C#**: First time using C#, learned a lot.
- **SQL lite**: First time using SQL lite to save and get data.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

This project helped me get an idea of how to start a project. Start with research, write everything down in steps and start working step by step. Also helped me get a basic understanding with C#.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Implementing more features
- Styling the application more
